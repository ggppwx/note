*** 2016-07-03 Sunday
playing game too much, nothing to say

*** 2016-07-04 Monday
- did apt cleaning, which is very good 
- sleep too late, bad
*** 2016-07-08 Friday
- stand-up meeting is changed to 10:30 
- gaming too much. not good. should set a timer for that. let's say
12:30 
- should follow schedule like when you are in collage
*** 2016-07-20 Wednesday
- should put more time on work
- [X] work on jira issues. jira issues are important.
** 2016-08 August
*** 2016-08-03 Wednesday
- 最近过的实在太糟糕了。
- 主要问题有以下几个：
  - 睡眠严重不足，这是由于玩total war导致的。为什么我们一玩这个游戏就停不下来呢？一大原因是电脑没有办法跑
    流畅。这导致我不断地微调系统，希望达到最佳设置。我在调系统上的热情甚至要大于游戏本身。Bad !
  - 计划的任务没有一个完成的。原因很无节制地玩游戏有关
  - 浪费时间在看新闻上。如果说玩游戏好歹还能带来快乐，那看美国政治新闻简直就是给自己添堵。我需要找到一个更
    合适的发泄情绪，表达观点的方式，比如写博客就不错。 因此，这个礼拜就不要在花时间看大选了
  - 没有及时反思问题。这导致了问题一拖再拖，各种挫折感。
  - 还是没有锻炼，身体越来越弱啊，还要lu。Bad ！
  - [ ] 最重要的问题还是自制力不强。表现在不管做什么都“刹不住车”。不管是学习，玩，看新闻，我应该要学会take a 
    break. 
- 当然也有进步，比如说现在能够利用commute的时间学习一点东西。感觉还是很有帮助的。 
- 还有一点进步是做了weekly review。better late than never

shit! I am still wasing time on those fucking forums. BAD BAD BAD!
*** 2016-08-08 Monday
- DOOM is exhausting. 
- shao lu. bu ran ying bu qi lai
- still spent too much time on news. should set a timer on that. 
- yeah, when i plan to do something, better clock-in that task. this helps 
  you focus on that single thing at a time.
- the good part: complete most task in last week. GOOD !
- no exercise for a month. need to change after miaomiao back
*** 2016-08-16 Tuesday
- miaomiao coming. 坠喜欢小猫瞄了。
- I should spent more time with xiao miaomiao, taking good care of her. don't be lazy. this should be 
  my highest priority 
- shoulder pain. exercise shoulder every 30 min. Besides, some workout might be helpful. If it doesn't 
  improve, go find a doctor
- solitude. staying alone makes you focus. writing journal every several days should really help.
- it's good to use fragmented time to learn. like watching online tutorial
*** 2016-08-18 Thursday
- did workout, pretty good. 
- I followed rules in work. good, keep doing that. 
  - this includes setting clock.
- dining out takes time. 
- I should not spend too much time on planing. use fragmented time to do this
*** 2016-08-19 Friday
I should put more focus on the actual tasks rather than creating tasks. Getting things done
is about doing rather than preparing.

for wasting time on it.

*** 2016-08-23 Tuesday
- Today I found several new tasks to do in the future. very good. 
- the thought process is like:
  - what should i do? unit test
  - can I do it right now? no, because we don't have good test cases?
  - what's the blocking issue? how to overcome? creating good test cases
  - can we do that? no, we don't know what the request looks like
  - what can be done? what if this is no longer blocked ? write xml request 
  - can we do something to improve this process ? yes. find way to make it easier to write test 
    cases 
- in the path, I also came up with a pet project idea. good. 
- bought irobot, time to clean the house
