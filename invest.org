*** thoughts 
- from the performance in scottrade account, most companies i bought are tech. most of them 
  have at least 100% after 5 years, which matches the increase of SPX
- generally speaking, IT companies beat the market, some companies has better performance than
  real estate market in China 
- most companies are at all-time high record, for example MSFT exceeds the value of bubble time
- for good companies, the lose in the market crash is tiny compared to the huge wins 
- the interest rate is still low comparing to 2000/2008. I think market will strive until interest 
  rate reaches another high level
